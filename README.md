# Worm-Game
This project is very similar to the the classic snake game where you control a little worm around, trying not to run into yourself or the wall, while collecting the food that is randomly placed around the playing field, growing your worm larger and larger making it harder to stay alive. This particular worm game uses WASD controls and rather than signle apples as food, a random number generator creates a score value for each piece of food. Not only does your worm get that value of points but when collected, that value will increase the worm by that number of lengths as well. For Instance, if you collect food of value 5, the worm would grow five lengths longer. The goal is to stay alive and eat as much as possible and try to get the highest score.
