# Worm-Game: Overview
This project is very similar to the classic snake game where you control a little worm around, trying not to run into yourself or the wall, while collecting the food that is randomly placed around the playing field, growing your worm larger and larger making it harder to stay alive. This particular worm game uses WASD controls and rather than single apples as food, a random number generator creates a score value for each piece of food. Not only does your worm get that value of points but when collected, that value will increase the worm by that number of lengths as well. For Instance, if you collect food of value 5, the worm would grow five lengths longer. The goal is to stay alive and eat as much as possible and try to get the highest score.

# Worm-Game: Project Structure
The project has three seperate classes and one header file containing constants. One class allows for a "cell" object that holds the coordinates on a two dimentional grid and allows for the other two classes to work in tandem. Another class handles the screen, which is a two dimentional vector, a vector of int vectors. This holds each cell for the screen and also works in tandem with a vector of cells that holds all of the currently free cells, allowing for food to be placed and for colision detection. The third class being used handles the implementation of a circular queue which is used to store the worm and where it is, using the cells and the screen classes.
